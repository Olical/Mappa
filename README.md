# What is Mappa?

Mappa is a tiny JavaScript framework that pretty much contains nothing.
The idea of Mappa is that you map functions from things you or other people have written into one pretty object.

This allows you to build your very own custom set of tools.

# Who wrote this thing?

That would be me, [Oliver Caldwell](http://flowdev.co.uk/).
I just came up with the idea on a train home from London.
